# APIProject
Contemporary streaming platforms have effectively taken over genre classification, determining how music is labeled, grouped, and understood at scale. These classifications are not just a means for organization; they shape listener perception, influence recommendation systems, and solidify how songs and artists are culturally framed over time. When a track is repeatedly categorized under a certain genre label (for example: “hip hop songs we think you’d like”) that categorization can become fixed in public consciousness, regardless of the artist’s intent or the music’s broader influences. This app aims to recenter this power to every day listeners, using the Last.fm API, and crossing that with the wikipedia api to offer a visual of genre worlds while also recognizing that genre classification will always be somewhat limiting. 
At first, my instinct was to heavily control the genre logic with a curated JSON file: hardcoded genres, parent–child relationships, regions, decades, etc. That worked conceptually, but it felt dishonest. It imposed my own assumptions onto music that already has a community-driven vocabulary. 
That’s when I pivoted. Instead of forcing tags into a predefined hierarchy, I let Last.fm’s user generated tags be the logic. These tags are messy, redundant, sometimes incorrect, but they’re real. They reflect how listeners actually talk about music. My role shifted from defining genres to filtering noise: removing location tags, era tags, platform artifacts, and anything that clearly wasn’t a genre. 
Once tags were coming directly from listeners, I needed a way to contextualize them historically without rewriting music history myself. Wikipedia API was then used to connect the user to all times of categories to pull subgenres and related movements through Wikipedia’s category system. And when that system fails, it fails visibly (with an explanation in yellow as to why a certain genre may not exist and why it’s important to recognize that failure). 
Visually, I wanted the interface to feel exploratory rather than instructional. A track sits at the center, its tags orbit it, and genres expand outward when you choose to follow one. The motion reinforces the idea that genre relationships aren’t fixed; they shift depending on where you start and what you choose to follow. The coloring is also meant to encourage continuity because as I was testing it, I was getting confused how each click was leading to somewhere else when the colors kept changing every time. There were some ideas I had to trash, like a + and - zoom feature that just messed with the D3 map too much, but it’s definitely something I want to play with even after I submit this project. 
My intentions changed a lot through this project but I’d say the most apt description would be that this app aims to emphasise that genre matters, not because it categorizes music cleanly, but because it tells stories, about scenes, influences, migration, and time. The map isn’t there to resolve ambiguity. It’s there to make it visible.
